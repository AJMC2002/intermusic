# Usage

Run the server first and then the client.
  - **Client:** Stores a list of ids, which are the Genius IDs of each song I have added.
  - **Server:** When the api is called, it will use Genius' api to fetch the song's information and using that information, it'll use it's url to scrape the lyrics and send it to the client.
